### V0.2.3
* Added BrowserSync.
* Improved jekyll build process and support for Jekyll on Windows (untested).
* `Gulp Watch` will also now watch .html files in `source/site` similar to css building. No need to run a second command for building Jekyll anymore.
* Updated README to reflect changes.
* There's now a default gulp command! Running just `gulp` will attempt to build existing assets, launch BrowserSync, and monitor any changes to your CSS/JS/HTML files. Your browser window will then be updated as changes are made to the files.
